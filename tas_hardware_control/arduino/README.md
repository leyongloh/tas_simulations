1. Structure of the TAS arduino GIT:

* Arduino driver
    * TAS_controller
        * include
        * remote_ctrl.ino
        * stepper.ino
        * TAS_controller.ino
    * libraries
        * FastAccelStepper
        * Herkulex
        * Rosserial_Arduino_Library            

2. How to set the libraries and compile:
    1. Download the newest Arduino IDE version from the website
    2. Set the sketchbook of the IDE to \Arduino driver directory and restart
    3. Choose the correct Arduino board and port
    4. Compile and upload
